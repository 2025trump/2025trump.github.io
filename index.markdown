It earned significant attention from the Trump Administration, as Heritage had accumulated a backlog of conservative ideas that had been blocked by President Barack Obama and his team. Soon after President Donald Trump was sworn in, his Administration began to implement major parts of the 2016 _Mandate_. After his first year in office, the Administration had implemented 64 percent of its policy recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

After his first year in office, the Administration had implemented 64 percent of its policy recommendations. President Joe Biden and his Administration have actively sought to undo many of the Trump Administration’s most important accomplishments, from border security to tax reform. Although Trump was not reelected, the Trump Administration provided Republicans with four years of examples of policies that worked and could work again if Republicans retake the presidency in 2024. This book, therefore, draws heavily on the Trump experience, and many of its recommendations build on Trump-era policies that were justifiably popular and effective. It does not do so out of blind partisanship or fealty to Donald Trump himself. Rather, its goal is to help the next Republican Administration and Congress succeed in restoring conservative policies and principles to Washington. It is an important and achievable goal that Heritage and the broader conservative movement will continue to support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It is a successor to the Mandate for Leadership series, which began at The Heritage Foundation in 1981. These books, published at the beginning of each presidential term, were designed to assist the new Administration in selecting and briefing appointees, reducing the size of government, and restoring constitutional order and republican principles. The 2025 project began under the title of “Project 2025,” but we now call it “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise.” The policy recommendations presented here draw on decades of conservative policy successes, including those from the recent past. They are designed to help the next conservative President achieve the policy success that America needs. The 2016 election of Donald Trump and his presidency were unlike anything in American history. Trump’s policy successes came from his instinctive and personal conservatism, his unbending determination, and the important contributions of many dedicated and talented appointees. But these were not just successes of personality and process. They were policy successes. This volume sets out many of those Trump policy accomplishments, particularly those of 2017–2020, and explains how the next President can build on those successes. |
